For the goalie, there are four main states: Scan 1, Scan 2, Calculate and Defend
In Scan 1, the goalie uses the ultrasound sensor to ping for objects within 40 centimeters
If there is any detection, sparki then loads the angle and distance within a calculation
array and moves into the second scan.
During the second scan, the goalie does another 40 centimeter ultrasound ping and loads in
the time difference between the scans, along with the second angle and distance into the
array, and jumps into calculations.
Sparki then determines the average travel distance needed to block the object, updates
its x and y values, sets its velocity and traversal position and moves to defend.
